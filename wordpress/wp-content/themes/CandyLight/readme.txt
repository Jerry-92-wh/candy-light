== Description ==

Built on a solidly designed foundation, CandyLight embraces the idea that everyone deserves a truly unique website. The theme’s subtle styles are inspired by the diversity and versatility of candles: its typography is waxy yet warm, its color palette is drawn from candy, and its layout elements sit warmly on the page.

The true richness of CandyLight lies in its opportunity for customization. The theme is built to take advantage of the Site Editor features introduced in WordPress 5.9, which means that colors, typography, and the layout of every single page on your site can be customized to suit your vision. It also includes dozens of block patterns, opening the door to a wide range of professionally designed layouts in just a few clicks.

Whether you’re building a single-page website, a blog, a business website, or a portfolio, CandyLight will help you create a site that is uniquely yours.
